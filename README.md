# Front-End Web Development with React Course

- This course was taken in Coursera, hosted by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
- In this course, I was introduced to React; React Class Components, Types, Router, Single Page Applications, Controlled & Uncontrolled Forms, introduced to Redux, Fetch and React Animations.
- This course taught me what React is and how to use React framework. After it, I went on to make multiple React Projects, increasing in complexity and in technologies used, like Typescript with React, and Electron.js with Typescript with React.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
